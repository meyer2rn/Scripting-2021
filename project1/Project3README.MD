I decided to do a different concept from Project 1 and 2. I came across a weight converter but I will be traveling nationally soon so I needed to know currency conversions. My project 3 is a currency converter.\

First, I would create a new file in Visual Studio Code. You can name this whatever you want :-).\
Once you have your file created, go to my Github page and copy my code for [Project 3](https://github.com/meyer2rn/it3038c-scripts/blob/main/project1/project3.py)\
Paste the code into your new file in Visual Studio Code and pull up a PowerShell terminal.\
Run the code with the following command:\
```bash
python project3.py
```
A screen like this will pop up:\

In the yellow box, please type in the amount of money you have in USD.\
Once you have put in your amount, click the red button "Convert" to convert.\
The numbers that pop up will show you how much your amount is in Euro, Yen, Pound, and Australian Dollar.\
You can perform multiple conversions.\
Like a regular window, you can minimize, maximize, restore down, or close the current window.\
To run the code again, run the following command:\
```bash
python project3.py
```
My reference page is [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-weight-conversion-gui-using-tkinter/). I added some coloring and symbols that go along with each currency.\
Thank you!
