I decided to do an add on of Project 1. Project 1 consisted of a basic calculator. In this project, I added a statement for equations divisible by zero and the emoji module.

First, let's import the module. 

```bash
pip install emoji
```

Now you can run the code.
It will start by asking for your name
```python
What is your name?
```
Enter your name and then it will continue to asking what operation you would like to use. You will just type in the symbol for the given operation.
There is addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and modulo to choose from.
If you choose subtraction and try to divide by zero, it will come back saying:
```python
YOU CANNOT DIVIDE BY ZERO
```
After the computation, it will ask if you want try the calculator again.
If you say 'y', the program will run again.
If you say 'n', it will tell you a farewell and have a wonderful day!
